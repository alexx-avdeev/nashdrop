<h1>Presenting... NashDrop!</h1>
<p><b>NashDrop</b> is an idea to help Nashville residents conveniently and responsibly dispose of or donate
their old/unused/unwanted items. This application will be a "one stop shop" where users can enter 
the items they want to drop off and view the locations here in Nashville where they can do so.</p><p>Gone
will be the days of Googling individual drop off items. Gone will be the days of "ctrl+f"-ing through the Nashville
recycling website trying to find a recycling center that takes what you want to give back. Read on to find out more!</p>

<h2>Why you should join the team:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Clearly defined and achievable use cases (we have a direction)</li>
    <li>Existing, easy to consume data sources (no wasting time data wrangling)</li>
    <li>Low complexity (we'll actually finish, beginner friendly)</li>
    <li>Not tech stack dependent (whatever works best for the team)</li>
    <li>Potential for cool stuff after MVP (no holds barred once we get our basic use cases)</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h2>What does this have to do with #NDoCH?</h2>

<p>As for its applicability to Nashville's National Civic Day of Hacking theme... never fear! This application
will utilize Nashville's open data portal to pull locations of three types of drop off centers:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Recycling centers (glass!)</li>
    <li>Libraries (not just books but CDs and DVDs too!)</li>
    <li>Medicine disposal centers (keep that stuff out of the water supply!)</li>
</ol>

<p>I think that surfacing these locations meets the city government transparency requirement, but what about
the "effective feedback mechanisms" we want to provide? Never fear because this application will log statistics
for every search entered into the application. Theoretically, the city would be able to view terms that its citizens
most often search and where they perform these searches. With this data, the city could better
allocate resources to provide additional drop off support where needed and identify new drop off
center opportunities that its citizens want.</p>

<h2>Data sources:</h2>

<p>Sticking with the theme of the event, I've narrowed this project down to three Nashville data portal data sources (for now!):</p>

<ol>
    <li>Recycling centers - <a href="https://data.nashville.gov/Recycling-Conservation/Public-Works-Recycling-Center-and-Drop-Off-Sites-O/j7nq-7ct5">https://data.nashville.gov/Recycling-Conservation/Public-Works-Recycling-Center-and-Drop-Off-Sites-O/j7nq-7ct5</a></li>
    <li>Libary locations - <a href="https://data.nashville.gov/Libraries/Library-Location-and-Facilities-Official/vn5u-d69i">https://data.nashville.gov/Libraries/Library-Location-and-Facilities-Official/vn5u-d69i</a></li>
    <li>Pharmaceutical disposal locations - <a href="https://data.nashville.gov/Police/Pharmaceutical-Disposal-Locations-Official/6zy8-syg9">https://data.nashville.gov/Police/Pharmaceutical-Disposal-Locations-Official/6zy8-syg9</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>Use Cases:</h2>

<h3>Must haves:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>As a user, I want to enter a search term to find matching drop off locations.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to view a list of drop off centers matching my search term.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to view a count of the terms searched on the application.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Nice to haves:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>As a user, I want to view the drop off centers matching my search on a map.
    <li>As a user, I want to view drop off centers by category.
    <li>As a user, I want to view the locations from which users searched for drop off sites.
    <li>As a user, I want to view the list of drop off centers in order of proximity to my location.
    <li>As a user, I want to view the count of searched terms by date.
    <li>As a user, I want to track the items I drop off for tax purposes later (extreme edge use case!).
</ol>
